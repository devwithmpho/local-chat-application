- I created this application as my school project for the year.

It is a chat application that uses MS Access as the database to handle all user authentication as well as actual chats. It's not really practical as it can only run from one device and doesn't make use of any networking, but I used this project to learn how to use a SQL database with a language like Java.

The application is mainly based on Java with ucanaccess to allow connection and queries to my local MS Access DB.
